Online Shopper Purchase Prediction
Project Overview

The Online Shopper Purchase Prediction project aims to analyze user behavior on an e-commerce platform and predict the likelihood of a purchase. Using real-world datasets, the project involves data cleaning, transformation, visualization, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and predictive modeling. The insights from this project can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, improve user engagement, and increase conversion rates.

Project Objective

Analyze online shopper behavior to identify factors influencing purchases.

Clean, transform, and visualize e-commerce data for actionable insights.

Build a predictive model to determine purchase likelihood.

Gain hands-on experience in data analytics, EDA, and predictive modeling using Python.

Dataset Description

Source: Publicly available online shopper data in CSV format.

Size: Thousands of records with user sessions, interactions, and purchases.

Key Features:

User_ID – Unique identifier for each visitor

Age, Gender – Demographic details

Browser, Device_Type, Country – Platform and location information

Time_on_Site, Pages_Visited, Session_Duration, Bounce_Rate – Session activity metrics

Referral_Source – Source from which the user arrived

Previous_Purchases, Cart_Value, Discount_Applied, Ad_Clicked – Shopping behavior metrics

Membership_Status, Preferred_Payment_Method – User account and payment preferences

Purchase_Made – Target variable indicating purchase completion

Time_of_Day, Feedback_Score – Session context and feedback

Project Workflow

Data Collection

Imported dataset using Pandas.

Verified column names, types, and structure.

Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and irrelevant records.

Filled missing values and corrected inconsistent entries.

Data Transformation

Created calculated columns such as total cart value, session conversion rate, or average purchase per user.

Converted categorical variables to numerical codes where necessary.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Conducted descriptive statistics to identify patterns and relationships.

Checked correlations between user activity metrics and purchase likelihood.

Identified trends such as time on site, referral source, membership status, and device type influencing purchases.

Data Visualization

Created charts to highlight key insights:

Bar Charts: Average cart value by membership status or referral source

Scatter Plots: Relationship between time on site and cart value

Heatmaps: Correlation among numerical features

Line Graphs: Trends across different times of day or user demographics

Predictive Modeling

Selected top features using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

Scaled features using MinMaxScaler.

Built a Logistic Regression model to predict purchase behavior.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy score and classification report.

Tools & Technologies

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Platforms: Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Key Findings

Users with higher time on site and more pages visited are more likely to make a purchase.

Referral source, membership status, device type, and time of day impact purchase behavior.

Discounts, previous purchases, and ad clicks influence the likelihood of a purchase.

Technical Skills Gained

Data cleaning, transformation, and preprocessing for accurate analysis

Descriptive statistical analysis and correlation studies

Data visualization for communicating insights to stakeholders

Feature selection and predictive modeling using Python

End-to-end workflow of a real-world data analytics project

Outcome

Practical experience in data analytics, EDA, and predictive modeling using Python.

Ability to transform raw online shopper data into actionable business insights.

Confidence to handle real-world analytics projects, applying statistical, visualization, and predictive modeling techniques.
